## ERR! code ENOSYS : 

Installs a node binary into your project, which because npm runs scripts with the local ./node_modules/.bin in the PATH ahead of the system copy means you can have a local version of node that is different than your system's, and manage node as a normal dependency.

Warning: don't install this globally with npm 2. npm@2 immediately removes node, then can't run the scripts that make this work.
Use

> npm i node@lts
